"""Every AO-dispatched (`assigned_vm: planning`) plan needs a gated finalize plan.

Operator ruling 2026-07-24 (task_template.md §4): a batch/source AO plan that ships
its own todos but never gets a companion `depends_on: [<slug>] + gate_on_depends: true`
finalize plan leaves two things stuck forever: source-doc checkboxes never get
reconciled (for extraction-style batch plans), and the plan itself never goes through
the archival ritual. This check finds `assigned_vm: planning` plans with NO other
active plan gating on them, per the pattern shipped for
`sports_closeout_batch1_ao_ready_2026_07_24.md` / `sports_closeout_batch1_finalize_2026_07_24.md`
and `sports_satellite_ao_dispatch_batch2_2026_07_24.md` /
`sports_satellite_ao_dispatch_batch2_finalize_2026_07_24.md`.

Exemptions (not violations):
  - The plan IS ITSELF a finalize plan (has its own `depends_on` + `gate_on_depends: true`)
    — no infinite regress.
  - The plan has exactly 1 open todo — trivial enough to fold archival into that todo's
    own done-when, per task_template.md's explicit single-todo carve-out.
  - `assigned_vm` is NOT `planning` (LOCAL/NA plans are untouched by AO dispatch, so this
    rule doesn't apply — archival there is a human call, not a machine-gate concern).

Second check (added 2026-07-30, same script — shares the frontmatter-loading infra):
a finalize plan (`depends_on` + `gate_on_depends: true`) sitting at `status: draft` is a
REDUNDANT double-gate, not a safety feature. `gate_on_depends` already machine-holds the
plan's tasks until its upstream is done (`_wire_gate_on_depends_prereqs` in
`regen_backlog_from_plan.py` covers both an already-active upstream via
`prereqs.completed_tasks` and a still-draft upstream via a derived
`gate-upstream-open:<stem>` condition read off the upstream file directly) — so stacking
`status: draft` on top requires a SEPARATE manual flip that nothing automates and nobody
reliably remembers. A 2026-07-30 corpus audit found 46 finalize plans stuck in draft this
way, most with their upstream already done and archived weeks earlier. Fix: author/ship
finalize plans `status: active` from the start (`ag-closeout-audit` SKILL.md corrected the
same day). This check ratchets that fix so it can't silently regress.

Exit-code semantics: 0 = at/below baseline (both checks); 1 = regression (either check);
2 = arg/IO error.

`--guard-parent <slug>` is a CREATION-time idempotency guard (not a corpus scan): it
re-derives gating over the CURRENT corpus and refuses (exit 1) if <slug> is already named
in some other plan's `depends_on` + `gate_on_depends: true` — an existing finalize
companion, regardless of that companion's filename shape (a redundant `_<date>` suffix
must not escape the guard). Exit 0 = parent not currently gated, safe to author a new
`<slug>_finalize*.md`. SSOT:
