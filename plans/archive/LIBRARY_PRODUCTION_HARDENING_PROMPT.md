# Library Production Hardening Prompt Template

**Purpose:** Comprehensive audit and hardening prompt for central shared libraries in the unified trading system.

**Target Libraries:** unified-trading-services, unified-config-interface, unified-events-interface,
unified-domain-client, unified-market-interface, unified-trade-execution-interface, unified-ml-interface,
execution-algo-library

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE (Replace `{UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE}` with actual library)

````
You are an AI agent whose sole responsibility is to audit and harden the **unified cloud servcies** repository to production-ready standards with 70%+ test coverage.

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT: This is a Central Shared Library

**{UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE}** is a CENTRAL LIBRARY used by 10-30+ downstream services/repos. Every function, class, and pattern you implement MUST be:
- ✅ Used by at least one downstream consumer (no dead code)
- ✅ Used consistently across ALL consumers (no version A in service X, version B in service Y)
- ✅ Enforced via unit tests that validate proper usage patterns
- ✅ Documented with clear examples and type hints
- ✅ Published to Google Artifact Registry (versioned releases)

**If functionality exists in {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} that NO service uses → Flag for my approval (remove or mandate adoption)**
**If functionality exists in MULTIPLE libraries → Flag for consolidation (one canonical implementation)**
**If services implement their own version instead of using {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} → Flag as violation (must use library)**

---

## YOUR MISSION

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit (Start Here)

Run a strict audit of {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} according to:
- `/Users/ikennaigboaka/Documents/repos/unified-trading-system-repos/AUDIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- All cursor rules in `/Users/ikennaigboaka/Documents/repos/unified-trading-system-repos/.cursor/rules/`
- All coding standards in `/Users/ikennaigboaka/Documents/repos/unified-trading-system-repos/unified-trading-codex/06-coding-standards/`

**Audit Dimensions:**

1. **Downstream Adoption Audit**
   - For EVERY exported function/class in {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE}:
     - [ ] Is it used by at least one downstream service?
     - [ ] Which services use it? (list them)
     - [ ] Are there services that SHOULD use it but don't? (flag violations)
   - **Output:** `ADOPTION_AUDIT.md` with usage matrix

2. **Implementation Consistency Audit**
   - Check if services implement their own versions of {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} functionality:
     - [ ] Search for duplicate implementations (e.g., custom config loaders when UCI exists)
     - [ ] Search for different patterns (e.g., some use `get_storage_client()`, others use `storage.Client()`)
     - [ ] Search for outdated patterns (e.g., `os.getenv()` instead of config classes)
   - **Output:** `CONSISTENCY_VIOLATIONS.md` with service-by-service breakdown

3. **Dead Code Audit**
   - Identify unused exports in {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE}:
     - [ ] Functions/classes with zero downstream usage
     - [ ] Deprecated patterns still in codebase
     - [ ] Backwards compatibility code that can be removed
   - **Output:** `DEAD_CODE_REPORT.md` for my approval (remove or mandate adoption)

4. **Duplication Audit**
   - Check if functionality exists in multiple libraries:
     - [ ] Same feature in {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} and another library (e.g., error handling in both UCS and UEI)
     - [ ] Different implementations of same concept (e.g., two retry decorators)
   - **Output:** `DUPLICATION_REPORT.md` for consolidation decisions

5. **Technical Debt Audit**
   - [ ] Backwards compatibility patterns (flag for removal)
   - [ ] Fallback imports (e.g., `try: from X except: from Y`)
   - [ ] Empty fallbacks (e.g., `.get("key", "")`)
   - [ ] Lazy imports (except for optional deps like web3, databento)
   - [ ] Circular import workarounds
   - **Output:** `TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` with removal plan

6. **Type Safety Audit**
   - [ ] Any types (must be exceptional, documented)
   - [ ] Missing type hints
   - [ ] Incomplete Protocol definitions
   - [ ] reportAny/reportUnknown* violations
   - **Output:** Type errors must be ZERO after hardening

7. **Test Coverage Audit**
   - [ ] Current coverage percentage (must reach 70%+ for central libraries)
   - [ ] Untested critical paths
   - [ ] Missing edge case tests
   - [ ] Test quality (synthetic fixtures, no real GCS data)
   - **Output:** `COVERAGE_PLAN.md` with path to 70%+

8. **Dependency Audit**
   - [ ] All dependencies in `pyproject.toml` are actually used
   - [ ] Version alignment with codex standards (pytest>=9.0.1, ruff==0.15.0, etc.)
   - [ ] No path dependencies (must use versioned releases)
   - [ ] Published to Google Artifact Registry
   - **Output:** Dependency violations fixed

9. **Import Standards Audit**
   - [ ] All imports at top of file (no lazy imports except documented exceptions)
   - [ ] No circular imports
   - [ ] Clean `__init__.py` exports (consumers import from top-level, not nested modules)
   - [ ] External import standards followed (see `.cursor/rules/external-import-standards.mdc`)
   - **Output:** Import violations fixed

10. **Quality Gates Audit**
    - [ ] `scripts/quality-gates.sh` exists and passes
    - [ ] Ruff version matches codex (==0.15.0)
    - [ ] basedpyright passes (blocking, no exceptions)
    - [ ] pytest-xdist for parallel execution
    - [ ] Coverage threshold enforced (70% for libraries)
    - **Output:** Quality gates pass in <3 minutes

11. **Artifact Registry Audit**
    - [ ] Library published to Google Artifact Registry
    - [ ] Version bumps before code changes (see `.cursor/rules/library-versioning.mdc`)
    - [ ] Cloud Build validates version uniqueness
    - [ ] Downstream services can install from registry
    - **Output:** Publishing workflow verified

---

### Phase 2: Downstream Enforcement

For EVERY service that should use {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE}:

1. **Verify Usage**
   - [ ] Service declares {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} in `pyproject.toml` dependencies
   - [ ] Service imports from {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} (not custom implementations)
   - [ ] Service uses canonical patterns (e.g., `UnifiedCloudConfig`, not `os.getenv()`)

2. **Unit Test Enforcement**
   - [ ] Service has unit tests validating proper {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} usage
   - [ ] Tests fail if service bypasses {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} (e.g., uses `os.getenv()` instead of config)
   - [ ] Tests enforce canonical patterns

3. **Standardization**
   - Take **instruments-service** as the role model for:
     - Dependency declaration patterns
     - Import patterns
     - Usage patterns
     - Test patterns
   - All services should match instruments-service patterns (unless documented deviation)

**Output:** `DOWNSTREAM_ENFORCEMENT.md` with per-service compliance matrix

---

### Phase 3: Hardening Execution

**Goals:**
- 70%+ test coverage (libraries are critical infrastructure)
- Zero type errors (basedpyright passes)
- Zero quality gate failures
- All functions <50-100 lines
- All files <900 lines (split if larger)
- Zero dead code (everything used by at least one service)
- Zero duplication (one canonical implementation)
- Zero technical debt (no backwards compatibility, no fallbacks)

**Constraints:**
- ❌ NO empty fallbacks (`.get("key", "")` for required config)
- ❌ NO backwards compatibility code (clean cutover, not gradual)
- ❌ NO lazy imports (except optional deps: web3, databento, or TYPE_CHECKING)
- ❌ NO circular imports (fix architecture, not workarounds)
- ❌ NO `Any` types (use Protocol, TypedDict, TypeVar)
- ❌ NO hardcoded project IDs (use config)
- ❌ NO broad `except Exception` (use decorators or specific exceptions)
- ❌ NO skipping tests (fix or remove irrelevant tests)
- ❌ NO duplicate implementations across libraries
- ❌ NO functionality that zero services use

**Execution Strategy:**
- Use parallel agents for independent work (max 4 concurrent)
- Break work into <1 hour tasks per agent
- Commit after every major block of work
- Run quality gates before every commit
- Document all architectural decisions in codex

---

## ALIGNMENT VALIDATION

### Venues & Data Types
Check that {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} supports all venues and data types in our universe:
- CEFI: Binance, Coinbase, etc. (see `unified-trading-deployment-v3/configs/venues.yaml`)
- DEFI: Uniswap, Aave, etc.
- TRADFI: NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.

**Validation:**
- Check `unified-trading-deployment-v3/configs/checklist.{service}.yaml` for capability requirements
- Check `unified-trading-deployment-v3/configs/data-catalogue.{service}.yaml` for data expectations
- Check `unified-trading-deployment-v3/configs/sharding.{service}.yaml` for sharding dimensions

**Ensure {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} supports ALL dimensions services need**

### Environment Alignment
- Local testing: Uses path dependencies via `[tool.uv.sources]`
- GitHub Actions: Installs from Artifact Registry via `pip.conf`
- Cloud Build: Installs from Artifact Registry via `pip.conf`

**Proper auth required for all three environments**

---

## SAMPLE SIZE & CSV DUMPING

{UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} should facilitate:
- CSV sample results (using UCS patterns)
- Sample size controlled via env var (e.g., `CSV_MAX_LINES`)
- Default: 0 in prod (disabled), configurable in dev (e.g., 1000)

**Pattern:**
```python
def dump_to_csv(data, max_lines: int | None = None):
    max_lines = max_lines or int(os.getenv("CSV_MAX_LINES", "0"))
    if max_lines == 0:
        return  # Disabled in prod
    # ... dump logic
````

---

## BATCH-LIVE SYMMETRY (If Applicable)

If {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} supports both batch and live modes:

- 90% code shared (mode-agnostic engine)
- Only 4 seams differ: data source, data sink, persistence thread, trigger
- Clearly document what live deviates on
- See `unified-trading-/codex/04-architecture/batch-live-symmetry.md`

---

## FINAL DELIVERABLE

A production-ready {UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE} with:

- ✅ 70%+ test coverage
- ✅ Zero quality gate failures
- ✅ Zero type errors
- ✅ Zero dead code
- ✅ Zero duplication across libraries
- ✅ 100% downstream adoption (all services use it properly)
- ✅ Unit tests enforce proper usage
- ✅ Published to Artifact Registry
- ✅ Ready to build on GitHub Actions, then Cloud Build, then deploy with UTDv3

**Are we clear? Ready for the audit of where we are and where we're going?**

**Write me the 7 required output documents (ADOPTION_AUDIT.md, CONSISTENCY_VIOLATIONS.md, DUPLICATION_REPORT.md,
TECHNICAL_DEBT.md, COVERAGE_PLAN.md, DOWNSTREAM_ENFORCEMENT.md, PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md) with detailed tasks.
No task should be >1 hour of wall time with 1 agent. In practice you will run parallel agents. It's all going to be done
by AI (you) so take that into account in your time estimates.**

```

---

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Copy this template**
2. **Replace `{UNIFIED_EVENTS_INTERFACE}` with actual library:**

   - unified-domain-client
   - unified-market-interface
   - unified-trade-execution-interface
   - unified-ml-interface
   - execution-algo-library

3. **Adjust library-specific context:**

## KEY DIFFERENCES FROM SERVICE PROMPT

| Aspect | Service Prompt | Library Prompt |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Coverage Target** | 35% min, 50% recommended | 70% min (libraries are critical) |
| **Downstream Enforcement** | N/A | CRITICAL - all services must use library properly |
| **Dead Code** | Remove | Flag for approval (might need to mandate adoption) |
| **Duplication** | N/A | CRITICAL - one canonical implementation per feature |
| **Artifact Registry** | N/A | REQUIRED - versioned releases |
| **Usage Validation** | N/A | Unit tests enforce proper usage in downstream services |
| **Role Model** | instruments-service | instruments-service (for dependency/import patterns) |

---

## EXAMPLE: unified-trading-services

**Adoption Audit Questions:**
- Which services use `get_storage_client()`? (should be ALL services with GCS I/O)
- Which services use `get_secret_client()`? (should be ALL services with secrets)
- Which services use `UnifiedCloudConfig`? (should be ALL services)
- Which services still use `os.getenv()` instead? (flag as violations)
- Which services use `storage.Client()` directly? (flag as violations)

**Consistency Violations:**
- instruments-service uses `get_storage_client()` ✅
- market-tick-data-handler uses `storage.Client()` ❌ (must fix)
- features-calendar uses `get_storage_client()` ✅
- ml-training uses custom GCS wrapper ❌ (must migrate to UCS)

**Dead Code:**
- `GCSFuseHelper` class (0 services use it) → Flag for approval
- `SecurityAuditLogger` class (0 services use it) → Flag for approval
- Old `BaseGCSLoader` (deprecated, replaced by `CloudStorageLoader`) → Remove

**Duplication:**
- Error handling decorators in both UCS and UEI → Consolidate into UEI
- Resource monitoring in both UCS and UEI → Consolidate into one library

**Technical Debt:**
- Backwards compatibility for old config patterns → Remove (clean cutover)
- Fallback imports for split libraries → Remove (all services migrated)
- Empty fallbacks in config loading → Remove (fail loud)

---

## NOTES

- This prompt is comprehensive and opinionated based on workspace standards
- It enforces fail-fast principles, no backwards compatibility, no technical debt
- It requires 70%+ coverage for libraries (higher than services)
- It mandates downstream adoption enforcement (no dead code, no duplication)
- It uses instruments-service as the role model for patterns
- It breaks work into <1 hour tasks for parallel agent execution

- ✅ Consistently used (no version A in service X, version B in service Y)
- ✅ Enforced via unit tests
- ✅ Zero dead code
- ✅ Zero duplication
- ✅ Zero technical debt
- ✅ 70%+ test coverage
- ✅ Published to Artifact Registry
- ✅ Ready for production deployment
