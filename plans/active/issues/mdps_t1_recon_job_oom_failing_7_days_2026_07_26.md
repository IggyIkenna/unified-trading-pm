title: MDPS t1-recon Cloud Run job OOMs every day — 7 consecutive failures, unrelated to reader-bridge deploy
summary: >-
  `uts-prod-market-data-processing-service-t1-recon` (GCP Cloud Run job, asia-northeast1) has failed EVERY scheduled
  execution for the past 7 days (2026-07-20 through 2026-07-26), each time with "The configured memory limit was
  reached" despite an already-generous 32Gi container limit. Discovered incidentally while triggering the job to verify
  the D3 reader-bridge deploy — the reader-bridge code is unrelated to this failure and is not implicated.

# MDPS t1-recon Cloud Run job — 7 consecutive daily OOM failures

## What I found

Triggered `uts-prod-market-data-processing-service-t1-recon` manually (execution
`uts-prod-market-data-processing-service-t1-recon-kv4br`) purely to confirm the D3 reader-bridge fix
(`market-data-processing-service@0035f79`, already on `origin/main`) runs correctly. The execution failed at
2026-07-26T14:35:19Z:

```
Task uts-prod-market-data-processing-service-t1-recon-kv4br-task0 failed with exit code: 0 and message:
The configured memory limit was reached.
```

Logs show the job successfully bootstrapped, validated cloud connectivity, and began "Processing candles for 2026-07-25"
across **all 5 asset groups** (`cefi, tradfi, defi, sports, prediction`) and a combined list of **~50 data_types** in
one process, before being OOM-killed ~22 minutes in.

**This is not a one-off.** `gcloud run jobs executions list` shows every execution for the past 7 days failed
(`status.conditions[type=Completed].status = False`):

| Execution                                              | Completion (UTC)     |

The job's container is already configured with a 32Gi memory limit
(`spec.template.spec.template.spec.containers[0] .resources.limits.memory`), so this is not a case of an
obviously-too-small default — either the per-run working set has grown past 32Gi (more instruments/data_types/history
than when this limit was set), or there is a memory leak / unbounded accumulation in the candle-derivation path for a
subset of these data_types. **Not investigated further here** — root-causing which asset_group/data_type combination is
actually driving the memory growth, and whether the fix is a memory bump, a workload split (per-asset-group executions
instead of one combined run), or a code-level leak fix, is a real engineering judgment call, not a bounded todo I can
resolve unattended.

## Why it matters

MDPS candle derivation for `t1-recon` has not completed successfully in at least 7 days across ALL FIVE asset groups —
this is the process that reconciles/backfills candles this job is meant to keep current. Silent for a week because the
failure produces `exit code: 0` (a clean-looking shutdown from the container platform's point of view) rather than a
loud crash — worth checking whether this job's failures are even reaching the standing CI/VM-billing-waste alerting
paths, since "exit code 0 but OOM-killed" is exactly the kind of ambiguous signal those monitors are built to catch.

## Recommended next step

Operator/engineer judgment call on the fix direction (memory bump vs. per-asset-group split vs. leak fix) — flagging
rather than resolving unilaterally, per this being a genuine design decision, not a scoped todo.

## Resolution update (2026-07-26, interactive session)

Root-caused (not just flagged) and fixed. `check_upstream_manifest_has_live_gap()` in
`market_data_processing_service/app/core/dependency_checker.py` read the upstream `availability_index.parquet` with
`columns=` pruning but **no date filter**. Confirmed via `RESOURCE_SAMPLE` log timing correlation (both RSS spikes —
15947MiB and 18706MiB — land entirely inside this one call's window, both times, deterministically) and via a direct
`pyarrow.parquet.ParquetFile` metadata check: the DEFI upstream index has grown to ~27.4M rows (~1.0GB compressed) vs
CEFI's 8.7M rows (~152MB) — an unfiltered decode of even a handful of pruned columns across every row still materializes
12-18GB of pandas/polars overhead. The sibling call `check_shard_freshness` (same function, called just before this one)
already applies `filters=[("date", "==", date)]` via UTL's row-group pushdown — this call site was simply the one left
unfiltered. Not a regression of the archived `mdps_filter_pushdown_memory_audit_and_fix_2026_05_28` plan's fix (that
covered scanner file-listing + per-day `gc.collect()`; this is a different, previously-uncovered call site).

**Fix shipped**: added `filters=[("date", "==", date)]` to match the established pushdown pattern, plus a regression
test asserting the kwarg is passed. QG green. `market-data-processing-service@6b44226` (landed on `live-defi-rollout`).

**Not yet verified against a real production run** — the fix needs to reach `main` (GCP Cloud Build only triggers on
push:main; it's currently only on `live-defi-rollout`, pending the normal ~15-60min auto-promotion) and a fresh image
built before `uts-prod-market-data-processing-service-t1-recon` can be re-triggered to prove the OOM is actually gone,
not just theoretically fixed. That's the one remaining step — see Todos.

## Todos

- [ ] [SCRIPT] P1. Once `market-data-processing-service@6b44226` has promoted to `main` and a fresh Cloud Build image
      exists (`gcloud builds list --project=central-element-323112` filtered to `market-data-processing-service`, or
      trigger manually), re-run
      `gcloud run jobs execute uts-prod-market-data-processing-service-t1-recon     --project=central-element-323112 --region=asia-northeast1`
      and confirm it completes successfully ( `status.conditions[type=Completed].status = True`) — a fresh
      `RESOURCE_SAMPLE` trend showing DEFI's memory no longer spiking past a few GB would confirm the fix, not just the
      absence of a crash. Flip this todo with the execution name + final status as evidence. (repo:
      market-data-processing-service)
