  LIVE, CURRENT outage: uts-prod-market-tick-data-service-fast-t1-recon OOM-kills nearly every SPORTS execution since
  ~2026-07-27 -- zero raw_tick_data writes for day=2026-07-30, 2026-07-31, 2026-08-01 (checked)
summary: >-
  Surfaced during a scheduled /data-pipeline-reconciliation sports run (2026-08-01). Direct GCS listing of
  market-data-tick-sports-prd-central-element-323112 found ZERO objects anywhere under raw_tick_data/by_date/ for
  day=2026-07-30, 2026-07-31, and 2026-08-01 (today, all pipeline_modes) -- a real writer-side gap, not a manifest-lag
  artifact (instruments-store-sports-prd, the canonical sports manifest bucket per the 2026-06-07 routing decision,
  independently confirms the same: batch_odds_api's own max date is 2026-07-29, with 0 rows for 07-30/07-31/08-01). Live
  Cloud Logging inspection of the shared Cloud Run Job uts-prod-market-tick-data-service-fast-t1-recon found the
  proximate cause: nearly every recent execution fails with "Task ... failed with exit code: 0 and message: The
  configured memory limit was reached" (8Gi limit) -- 846/846 sampled ERROR log entries in a 1h45m window
  (2026-08-01T09:00-10:45Z) carry --asset-group SPORTS, and the OOM pattern is confirmed present as far back as
  2026-07-27T12:00-13:00Z (0 OOM errors found at 2026-07-27T00:00-01:00Z, so onset is bounded to that ~11h window on
  07-27), continuously through the 2026-08-01T10:43Z check time -- i.e. this has been silently failing in production for
  5+ days. Cloud Scheduler (uts-prod-sports-scheduler-cron, */5min, ENABLED) and the odds-api-key credential
  (live-verified HTTP 200) are both confirmed healthy -- this is NOT the future-date-guard bug
  (market-tick-data-service@410d7569, fixed 2026-07-26) or the odds-api-key deactivation
  (sports_odds_api_key_deactivated_2026_07_26.md, rotated 2026-07-29) recurring; it is a distinct, new failure mode.
  Root cause of the memory blowup itself was NOT identified this pass (would need code-level profiling/reading of the
  fast-t1-recon SPORTS code path, out of scope for a read-only reconciliation audit) -- flagged as a hypothesis only:
  the timing (onset the day after the 07-26 future-date-guard fix shipped, which made SPORTS same-day dispatches proceed
  to full processing instead of no-op'ing immediately) is suggestive but NOT confirmed causal.

# Sports fast-t1-recon Cloud Run Job: live OOM outage, zero SPORTS raw-tick writes since ~2026-07-27

## What I found

While running a scheduled `/data-pipeline-reconciliation --asset-group sports` checkpoint (2026-08-01), the Phase-0
resolution gate's index-freshness read showed `market-data-tick-sports-prd`'s own manifest had unexpectedly caught up
(628,446 rows, max date 2026-07-29 -- a big jump from the 2026-07-24 report's 465,223 rows / max date 2026-07-20,
explained by a large 2026-07-25/07-26 catch-up write, 19,827 + 31,661 rows respectively, that coincides with the
`sports_odds_capture_pipeline_scheduling_status_unknown_2026_07_23.md` investigation/fix window). But the manifest also
showed **zero `batch_odds_api` rows for 2026-07-27, 2026-07-28, 2026-07-30, and 2026-07-31** (07-29 partially recovered
with 1,796 rows) -- a pattern worth checking against the live GCS estate directly rather than trusting the manifest
alone.

**Direct GCS listing confirms this is real, not a manifest artifact.** Listed `raw_tick_data/by_date/day={D}/`
(delimiter-scoped, no full-corpus walk) for `market-data-tick-sports-prd-central-element-323112`:

| day                                           | pipeline_mode prefixes found                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2026-07-29                                    | `pipeline_mode=batch_odds_api/` (23 venue prefixes, real content) |
| 2026-07-30                                    | **NONE**                                                          |
| 2026-07-31                                    | **NONE**                                                          |
| 2026-08-01 (today, partial day at check time) | **NONE**                                                          |

**Cross-checked against the canonical sports manifest bucket** (`instruments-store-sports-prd`, per the 2026-06-07
sports-manifest-canonicalisation routing decision -- this is NOT the F1/cross-bucket-routing artifact from the
2026-07-24 report, since BOTH buckets agree here): `batch_odds_api`'s own max date in that manifest is also
**2026-07-29**, with 0 rows for 07-30/07-31/08-01. Two independent surfaces (this bucket's own index + the
architecturally-canonical sibling index) agree: nothing has been captured for 3 consecutive days as of the check.

## Root cause (proximate, confirmed) -- Cloud Run Job OOM

Live `gcloud logging read` against
`resource.type="cloud_run_job" AND resource.labels.job_name="uts-prod-market-tick-data-service-fast-t1-recon"` found the
job (the shared "fast" tier Cloud Run Job serving SPORTS/PREDICTION/DEFI per-fixture live dispatches, 8Gi memory / 2 CPU
limit per `spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.limits`) is failing almost every execution with:

```
Task uts-prod-market-tick-data-service-fast-t1-recon-<id>-task0 failed with exit code: 0 and message:
  The configured memory limit was reached.
```

- **Scope confirmed SPORTS-specific**: 846/846 sampled ERROR log entries (window 2026-08-01T09:00-10:45Z) carry
  `--asset-group SPORTS` in the execution's container args -- 0 PREDICTION or DEFI executions observed failing in the
  same sample, despite sharing the same job/image/memory limit.
- **Onset bounded to 2026-07-27**: hourly sampling found 0 OOM-tagged ERROR entries in the 2026-07-27T00:00-01:00Z
  window, 42 in the 2026-07-27T12:00-13:00Z window -- onset is somewhere in that ~11h span. Confirmed present (with
  varying hourly volume, 7-255 errors/hour sampled) continuously through the 2026-08-01T10:43Z check time.
- **Not the future-date-guard bug or the odds-api-key deactivation recurring**: `uts-prod-sports-scheduler-cron` (Cloud
  Scheduler, `*/5 * * * *`) is firing correctly and ENABLED; the `odds-api-key` secret was live-curled
  (`https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports?apiKey=...`) and returned **HTTP 200** with `x-requests-remaining: 5000000`
  (the 2026-07-29 rotation is still valid, not re-deactivated). This is a distinct, new failure mode from both prior
  sports capture incidents.
- **Underlying memory-blowup root cause NOT identified this pass** -- this would need code-level profiling or reading of
  the SPORTS fast-t1-recon dispatch path (`market_tick_data_service` CLI handler + the per-fixture `odds_api_adapter.py`
  fetch loop), which is out of scope for a read-only `/data-pipeline-reconciliation` audit. **Hypothesis only, not
  confirmed**: the OOM onset (2026-07-27, ~11h-24h after `market-tick-data-service@410d7569` shipped 2026-07-26) is
  suggestively close to the future-date-guard fix that made SPORTS same-day dispatches proceed to full `process_ticks()`
  instead of no-op'ing immediately on `DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE` -- if same-day dispatches now do meaningfully more work (real
  fetch + write, previously skipped entirely), a latent per-fixture memory issue that was previously masked by the no-op
  path could now be exposed at the current per-cycle dispatch volume. This is a lead for the next dispatch to check
  first, not a proven mechanism.

## Why it matters

This is a `data-pipeline-correctness-hard-rule` **big finding**: live sports odds capture (pre-kickoff horizon-grid
snapshots) has been silently near-zero for at least 3 consecutive days as of this check (2026-07-30, 07-31, and today's
partial day), immediately following a partial recovery from the _previous_ month-long capture gap
(`sports_batch_odds_api_capture_outage_recurrence_check_2026_07_26.md`). The job "succeeds" from Cloud Run's
completion-code perspective in the sense that it retries and eventually reports (exit code 0 message, not a hard crash
the scheduler alerts on) -- there is no loud failure signal distinguishing this from healthy operation unless someone
reads the manifest max-date or GCS directly, exactly the async-wait-discipline trap CLAUDE.md already warns about (an
entity-agnostic Cloud Run "job ran" signal passes while the target entity, SPORTS raw-tick capture, writes zero real
rows).

## Recommended next steps

- [ ] [OPERATOR] P0. Decide on an immediate mitigation while root-cause is investigated: raise the fast-t1-recon Cloud
      Run Job's memory limit (`spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources.limits.memory`, currently `8Gi`) as a stop-gap
      to unblock live capture, vs. leaving it OOM-failing until the underlying leak/blowup is found and fixed (a config
      bump risks masking a real leak that will recur at a higher ceiling; a operator call on risk/urgency tradeoff, not
      a worker one -- live capture has been down 3+ days as of this check). Done when: operator states a direction and
      (if raising the limit) it is applied + a fresh execution is confirmed writing real raw_tick_data objects for the
      current day.
- [ ] [DATA] P0. Root-cause the SPORTS-specific memory blowup in the fast-t1-recon dispatch path -- profile or code-read
      `market_tick_data_service`'s CLI handler + `odds_api_adapter.py`'s per-fixture fetch loop for the current
      `--asset-group SPORTS --start-date <today> --end-date <today>` invocation shape; test the
      future-date-guard-fix-exposure hypothesis above directly (e.g. diff memory behavior of a same-day SPORTS dispatch
      before vs after `410d7569` in a sandboxed run, or profile a live execution). Done when: a specific code-level
      cause is identified and either fixed or explicitly ruled out as the future-date-guard interaction. (repo:
      market-tick-data-service)
- [ ] [DATA] P1. Once fixed, backfill/re-fetch the resulting gap (2026-07-27, 2026-07-28, 2026-07-30, 2026-07-31, plus
      whatever additional days elapse before the fix ships) via the Odds-API historical endpoint, same pattern as the
      prior month-long-gap backfill in `sports_batch_odds_api_capture_outage_recurrence_check_2026_07_26.md` item 1 --
      coordinate so this doesn't duplicate that backfill's own in-flight/approved scope if it hasn't run yet. Done when:
      the manifest (`instruments-store-sports-prd`, manifest-only read, no GCS walk) shows full coverage for the
      affected date range at the intended granularity. (repo: market-tick-data-service)
- [ ] [DATA] P2. Check whether PREDICTION and DEFI's fast-t1-recon dispatches are at risk of the same OOM class even
      though 0/846 sampled errors this pass were non-SPORTS -- a scoped blast-radius check (same method as
      `sports_batch_odds_api_capture_outage_recurrence_check_2026_07_26.md`'s DeFi/Prediction check) rather than an
      assumption that SPORTS-only observed means SPORTS-only affected. (repo: market-tick-data-service)

## Verdict

**Root cause of the SYMPTOM found and confirmed live (Cloud Run Job memory-limit OOM, SPORTS-scoped, since ~2026-07-27,
ongoing)**; root cause of the underlying memory blowup NOT yet found (code-level investigation needed). Notified
operator per the data-pipeline-correctness-hard-rule big-finding trigger via this issue doc + the dispatching
reconciliation report's prominent flag.

## Progress Log

**2026-08-01 (dispatched sub-agent, `/data-pipeline-reconciliation sports` checkpoint run)** -- Found while verifying
the 2026-07-24 report's F1 (manifest-staleness) finding's current status. F1 itself is RESOLVED (confirmed via
`sports_odds_capture_pipeline_scheduling_status_unknown_2026_07_23.md`'s already-filed addendum, resolved 2026-07-26:
deliberate architecture, not a bug). While confirming F1's resolution held, found the manifest had a NEW, more recent
gap (07-27 onward) that F1's own resolution didn't cover. Traced it to a live Cloud Run Job OOM via direct
`gcloud logging read` + `gcloud run jobs executions list` (not inferred) -- see evidence above. Filed this issue doc;
full detail also cross-referenced in the dispatching reconciliation report.
