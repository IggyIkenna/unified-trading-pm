  DeFi venues axis carries 14 non-DeFi tokens (9 chain names + 5 CeFi exchange names); defi+cefi chains axis carries a
  shared `FUTURES` contamination — net-new since the 2026-07-25 census refresh, not yet root-caused
summary: >-
  distinct_values_noncanonical_audit_2026_07-20.md's 2026-07-28 census refresh (dispatched via
  cross_cutting_satellite_ao_dispatch_batch1_2026_07_26.md's line-191 todo) found defi.venues carrying 16 non-canonical
  values, 14 of which are NOT DeFi-protocol-shaped: 9 are literal chain names (ARBITRUM, AURORA, AVALANCHE, BASE, BSC,
  ETHEREUM, LINEA, OPTIMISM, POLYGON) and 5 are CeFi exchange names (BITFINEX, BITGET, BYBIT, KRAKEN, OKX) — tokens that
  belong on a different axis (chain) or a different asset_group (cefi) entirely, not on the defi venue axis. Separately,
  `defi.chains` and `cefi.chains` both carry a non-canonical `FUTURES` value — cefi has NO chain axis at all per this
  same plan's own RESULT 3 finding (`UAC SHARD_AXIS_MATRIX[(MTDS,cefi)]` has no `chain` axis), and `FUTURES` is a tradfi
  instrument_type spelling, not a chain — suggesting a shared, not-yet-identified cross-axis or cross-asset-group write
  path. This doc catalogues the finding + the two most plausible root-cause classes (wrong-axis writer mis-stamp vs.
  cross-AG manifest-consolidator bleed, the latter matching the shape of the ALREADY-RESOLVED
  `cross_ag_prediction_rows_bleed_into_sports_instruments_index_2026_07_20.md` TOCTOU bug,
  `unified-trading-library@14301571`, shipped 2026-07-24) without executing a fix — this is a genuine cross-repo,
  cross-asset-group data-correctness finding per this workspace's findings-triage rule ("big finding" — NOTIFY OPERATOR
  + issue doc), not investigated to root cause here (read-only audit scope, time-bounded).

# DeFi/CeFi venue+chain axis cross-contamination (2026-07-28)

## What I found

Live `GET /distinct-values/{asset_group}` (in-process, `source_date=2026-07-28`) for defi + cefi:

**`defi.venues` (16 non-canonical, up from the 2026-07-25 refresh's already-flagged-but-unclassified set):**

- **2 already-known/tracked**: `BLAZESTAKE`, `HYPERLIQUID` — `phase=="pipeline"` grain exceptions, covered by
  `defi_venue_phase_live_definition_contradiction_2026_07_22.md`.
- **9 NEW — literal chain names, not DeFi protocol venues**: `ARBITRUM`, `AURORA`, `AVALANCHE`, `BASE`, `BSC`,
  `ETHEREUM`, `LINEA`, `OPTIMISM`, `POLYGON`. Every one of these is a real, canonical `MAINNET_CHAIN_IDS` member — they
  belong on the `chain` axis, not `venue`.
- **5 NEW — CeFi exchange names, not DeFi protocol venues**: `BITFINEX`, `BITGET`, `BYBIT`, `KRAKEN`, `OKX`. Every one
  of these is (or resolves to, via `CEFI_VENUE_ACCEPTED_NONCANONICAL_ALIASES` fold) a real cefi venue — they belong in
  the `cefi` asset_group's manifest, not defi's.

**`defi.chains` (2 non-canonical)**: `HYPERLIQUID` (already tracked, cross-refs the venues finding above), `FUTURES`
(NEW — not a chain name at all).

**`cefi.chains` (1 non-canonical)**: `FUTURES`. Per this same plan's RESULT 3 (2026-07-20), `chain` is a MEANINGLESS
axis for cefi (`UAC SHARD_AXIS_MATRIX[("market-tick-data-service","cefi")]` has no `chain` axis) — the
`onchain_perp_batch_handler.py` venue-as-chain bug that caused the ORIGINAL cefi chain contamination was already fixed
(`mtds@accd8aa4`) and re-stamped. `FUTURES` appearing now is either a NEW writer path (not the one RESULT 3 fixed)
independently stamping `chain`, or un-restamped historical residue from a different source.

## Why it matters

Two candidate root-cause classes, neither confirmed:

1. **Wrong-axis writer mis-stamp (cat-3)** — a defi/cefi writer is putting the wrong token in the wrong manifest column
   (e.g. defaulting `venue` to the `chain` value when the real venue is unresolved, or a bundle-grain `instrument_type`
   value like `futures_chain`/`FUTURES` leaking into the `chain` column for cefi/defi rows).
2. **Cross-asset-group manifest bleed (cat-3, cross-AG)** — the CeFi exchange names in `defi.venues` in particular look
   like a cross-AG bleed (cefi rows landing in the defi manifest), the SAME SYMPTOM SHAPE as the already-resolved
   `cross_ag_prediction_rows_bleed_into_sports_instruments_index_2026_07_20.md` finding (a fleet-wide TOCTOU race in
   `manifest_consolidator.py`'s CAS write path, fixed `unified-trading-library@14301571`, shipped 2026-07-24, "holds"
   per that doc's own ROUND 8 section). Whether this is a NEW instance of the same bug class, un-cleaned residue from
   before the fix, or an unrelated mechanism is NOT determined here.

This is flagged as a **big finding** per this workspace's findings-triage rule (cross-repo, cross-asset-group, plausible
SSOT-adjacent data-correctness issue) — filed for operator visibility + the next investigation, not chased to root cause
in this read-only audit pass (time-bounded scope).

## Recommended decision

- [ ] [DIAG] P1. Trace which writer/consolidator path produces the 9 chain-shaped and 5 cefi-exchange-shaped values on
      `defi.venues` — sample a handful of the actual manifest rows (venue, chain, source, pipeline_mode columns
      together) to distinguish "writer defaults venue to chain when unresolved" from "cross-AG bleed". Source: this doc.
- [ ] [DIAG] P1. Trace which writer stamps `chain="FUTURES"` for defi + cefi rows — sample the actual rows (venue,
      instrument_type, data_type alongside chain) to determine if this is the bundle-grain `futures_chain`/`FUTURES`
      instrument_type leaking into the chain column, or an unrelated mis-stamp. Check whether this is a NEW regression
      of the resolved TOCTOU consolidator bug (re-run the `cross_ag_prediction_rows_bleed` doc's own diagnostic query
      against defi/cefi) before assuming a new mechanism. Source: this doc.
- [ ] [DATA] P2. Once root-caused, fix the writer (if writer bug) or the consolidator (if TOCTOU regression) and
      re-stamp affected historical rows per the paired writer-fix + re-stamp pattern already used for the cefi
      venue-as-chain fix on this same plan. Source: this doc.
