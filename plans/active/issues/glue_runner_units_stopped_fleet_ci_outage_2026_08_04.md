title:
  "Two self-hosted glue-runner systemd units left INACTIVE on the planning VM stall UAC LDR->main promotion and cascade
  a Tier-A CI outage across 11 dependent repos (instruments-service main QG-v2 RED is a symptom, not a code bug)"
summary: >-
  Slot 11 (agt-152447, BLK-37a5da89, 2026-08-04) fully root-caused instruments-service's main quality-gates-v2 RED as a
  cascading INFRA outage, not a code defect: instruments-service code+tests are GREEN on LDR. Chain: (1) two dedicated
  self-hosted GitHub-Actions glue-runner units are stopped/inactive on the planning VM (ip-172-31-5-118) —
  `github-glue-runner-unified-api-contracts@glue-1.service` (inactive) and
  `github-glue-runner-instruments-service@glue-1.service` (externally `systemctl stop`-ped 09:01:57; `Restart=always`
  never fired because an explicit stop suppresses it). (2) UAC's LDR quality-gates-v2 for commit d67a226f (the OKX_SWAP
  venue-registry cleanup already consumed by instruments-service LDR code) has been stuck QUEUED ~1hr (run 30894307404)
  with no runner to pick it up. (3) UAC therefore cannot promote LDR->main (its own ci_status=FAILING), and the fleet
  dep-order/Tier-A gate (bottom-up drain) blocks all 11 dependent repos incl. instruments-service. (4)
  instruments-service's own LDR run (30894282946) is likewise stuck on its stopped runner. Main agt-1756f6 INDEPENDENTLY
  VERIFIED (read-only `systemctl is-active`): both named units are `inactive` while all 11 OTHER repos'
  `github-glue-runner-*@glue-1.service` units are `active/running` — corroborating the two-unit anomaly. **Neither the
  worker nor main can fix it**: `sudo` is blocked by a no-new-privileges flag for both, and neither has AWS SSM
  (`ikenna-worker` lacks `ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation`). Needs someone with host root on the planning VM (or SSM) to
  `systemctl start` the two units. Secondary finding: the glue-runner-crash-loop-watchdog does NOT catch this class — it
  only flags units actively crash-looping (repeated restarts), not a unit sitting cleanly `inactive`/stopped.

# Fleet CI outage: two stopped glue-runner units block UAC->main + 11 dependent repos

> **🔴 FLEET CI OUTAGE — 11 repos' LDR->main promotion blocked ~1h+ by two stopped self-hosted runners on the planning
> VM. Immediate fix needs host root (`systemctl start` ×2). instruments-service main QG-v2 RED is a SYMPTOM — do NOT
> "fix" instruments-service code; it is GREEN on LDR.**

## Root-cause chain (slot-11-diagnosed, main-verified)

1. `github-glue-runner-unified-api-contracts@glue-1.service` — **inactive** on ip-172-31-5-118 (main verified via
   `systemctl is-active`). No runner => UAC LDR quality-gates-v2 for `d67a226f` stuck **QUEUED ~1h** (run 30894307404,
   `workflow_dispatch`).
2. `github-glue-runner-instruments-service@glue-1.service` — **inactive**; per slot-11, explicitly `systemctl stop`-ped
   at 09:01:57 (external stop => `Restart=always` suppressed), stuck since. instruments-service LDR run 30894282946 has
   no runner.
3. UAC cannot promote LDR->main (own `ci_status=FAILING`); the dep-order / Tier-A bottom-up-drain gate blocks all 11
   dependent repos incl. instruments-service — so instruments-service **main** QG-v2 is RED purely because it resolves
   `unified-api-contracts` against a STALE UAC main (missing `d67a226f`'s OKX_SWAP venue-registry cleanup, already on
   UAC LDR + already consumed by instruments-service LDR). The 4 failing OKX-SWAP venue tests are the visible symptom.
4. All 11 OTHER repos' `github-glue-runner-*@glue-1.service` units are `active/running` (main verified) — confirming the
   two named units are the isolated anomaly, not a fleet-wide runner-config problem.

## Why neither worker nor main can self-serve

`sudo` is blocked by a `no-new-privileges` flag for BOTH the worker session and main agt-1756f6 (verified `sudo -n true`
=> "no new privileges" error). Neither has AWS SSM (`ikenna-worker` lacks `ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation`). Restarting
a systemd unit needs host root / SSM on the planning VM — genuinely operator-gated.

## Todos

- [ ] [OPERATOR] P1. **Immediate host action (unblocks 11 repos).** On the planning VM (ip-172-31-5-118), with root:
      `sudo systemctl start github-glue-runner-unified-api-contracts@glue-1.service` and
      `sudo systemctl start github-glue-runner-instruments-service@glue-1.service`; confirm both go `active (running)`
      (`systemctl is-active …`). Then re-verify UAC LDR run 30894307404 (and instruments-service 30894282946) leave
      QUEUED and go green, and the `ldr-to-main-promote-fleet` job picks UAC up on its next ~5-15min tick, draining the
      Tier-A gate for the 11 dependent repos. If the instruments-service unit was stopped deliberately (external
      `systemctl stop` 09:01:57), confirm no in-flight maintenance conflicts before starting. (planning VM — operator
      host action)
- [ ] [INFRA] P2. **Close the monitoring gap.** The glue-runner-crash-loop-watchdog only flags units actively
      crash-looping (repeated restarts), so a runner sitting cleanly `inactive`/stopped (Restart=always suppressed by an
      explicit stop) evades detection — exactly this incident. Extend the watchdog (or add a sibling check) to alert
      when any expected `github-glue-runner-<repo>@glue-1.service` is `inactive`/`dead`/`failed` for > N minutes while
      peer runners are active, so a stopped runner pages instead of silently stalling promotion for an hour. Repo:
      agent-orchestrator (deployment/monitoring). Cross-ref `/codex/05-infrastructure/deployment-observability.md`,
      `/codex/04-architecture/ci-alerting.md`.

## Progress Log

- **2026-08-04 (main agt-1756f6)** — Filed on slot-11's BLK-37a5da89. Independently verified (read-only `systemctl`):
  both named units `inactive`; all 11 peer `@glue-1` runners `active/running`; main also lacks sudo (no-new-privileges)
  so cannot self-serve. Answered the blocked question (Option A — operator host restart; disposition partial, the fix is
  operator-executed) and told slot-11 to stand down (fully diagnosed, nothing more it can do). This is a big finding
  (fleet CI outage, 11 repos, CI-critical path) — routed to the operator via this P1 issue doc's `[OPERATOR]` todo.
