  "Global QG pytest --timeout=60 (base-library.sh) flakes on GH Actions CI — 2nd confirmed instance of the
  60s-wall-clock-under-contention bug class, this time on a hosted CI runner, not just local shared-host"
summary: >-
  unified-api-contracts' quality-gates-v2 went RED on live-defi-rollout (commit f50defe3, an unrelated ASTER-collateral
  registry fix) because tests/test_cassette_offline_check.py::test_vcr_cassette_interactions_is_list[bybit/ticker.yaml]
  hit `Failed: Timeout (>60.0s) from pytest-timeout.` — 1 of 12125 tests. That test only parses a 2KB, pure-offline YAML
  fixture (docstring: "run without any live network calls"); isolated re-run measured 0.04s. The 60s budget comes from a
  HARDCODED, non-overridable `--timeout=60` in the SHARED `unified-trading-pm/scripts/quality-gates-base/
  base-library.sh` PARGS line (used by every repo's pytest slice, unlike the two sibling knobs on the same line block —
  PYTEST_WORKERS/PYTEST_UNIT_DIR — which ARE env-overridable). Two subsequent LDR gate runs on later commits came back
  green (via content-sentinel skip). This is the same bug CLASS as
  `/plans/active/issues/adapter_contract_regression_ratchet_60s_timeout_flaky_under_contention_2026_07_27.md` (a fixed
  60s `run_timeout` wall-clock wrapper flaking under shared-host I/O contention) — but that issue's own todo 3 left open
  "does GH Actions CI see the same contention profile, or is this slot-worktree-local only?" This occurrence answers it:
  YES, the pattern also fires on GH Actions-hosted `quality-gates-v2` runs, not only local multi-slot hosts — likely via
  intra-job `pytest-xdist -n auto` worker contention (CI branch of the same PARGS line auto-scales workers to the
  runner's core count) rather than cross-job host sharing.

# Global QG `--timeout=60` (base-library.sh) flakes on GH Actions CI, not just local shared hosts

## What was found

While resolving `ldr_qg_failure` escalation `agt-fa86c9` for `unified-api-contracts` (LDR RED at commit `f50defe3`,
"fix(registry): correct ASTER collateral haircuts + add BTC/ETH rows"), the failing GH Actions run (`30424080892`,
`QG slice (tests)` job) showed:

```
FAILED tests/test_cassette_offline_check.py::test_vcr_cassette_interactions_is_list[bybit/ticker.yaml] - Failed: Timeout (>60.0s) from pytest-timeout.
= 1 failed, 12125 passed, 741 skipped, 5 xfailed, 2 warnings in 686.98s (0:11:26) =
```

One test, out of 12125, timed out. `test_cassette_offline_check.py`'s own module docstring: "Canary offline check —
validate ALL cassette YAML structure without network calls... These checks run without any live network calls." The
specific fixture (`unified_api_contracts/external/bybit/mocks/ticker.yaml`) is 2019 bytes / 50 lines. Re-running just
that test id in isolation (same tree, same worktree, moments later):

```
tests/test_cassette_offline_check.py::test_vcr_cassette_interactions_is_list[bybit/ticker.yaml] PASSED [100%]
1 passed, 157 deselected in 0.04s
```

0.04s vs a 60s budget — a >1000x margin. There is no plausible code path in this test (pure `yaml.load` via the C
`CSafeLoader` + an `isinstance` check) that legitimately takes anywhere near 60s on a 2KB file. The commit that
triggered the escalation (`f50defe3`) touched only `unified_api_contracts/registry/venue_collateral.py` and its own unit
test — an unrelated subsystem. This was not a regression; it was a scheduling-induced wall-clock timeout.

**Root cause**: `unified-trading-pm/scripts/quality-gates-base/base-library.sh:391`:

```bash
PARGS="-n ${_PYTEST_N} --timeout=60 -q -r a --tb=short --no-header --durations=25"
```

`--timeout=60` is a literal, hardcoded value with **no env-var override** — unlike its two neighbors on the surrounding
lines, `PYTEST_WORKERS` (line 384: "Explicit PYTEST_WORKERS wins") and `PYTEST_UNIT_DIR` (line 395,
`"${PYTEST_UNIT_DIR:-tests/unit/}"`), both of which follow the established per-repo-override pattern this repo already
uses elsewhere in the same file. This flag is applied to **every test, in every repo**, via the shared library every
`scripts/quality-gates.sh` sources.

## Why this matters / relation to the precedent issue

This is the same bug CLASS as
`/plans/active/issues/adapter_contract_regression_ratchet_60s_timeout_flaky_under_contention_2026_07_27.md`: a fixed 60s
wall-clock timeout that fires under contention regardless of whether the underlying check would have passed, on a
completely unrelated diff. That issue diagnosed the mechanism as **shared-host I/O contention** (3-7 concurrent
`quality-gates.sh` processes across slots on the same physical host) and fixed it by raising the specific script's
`run_timeout` 60→300 in each of 4 repos' own `scripts/quality-gates.sh` copies (a repo-local, low-blast-radius change
each time, since `no_adapter_contract_regression.sh`'s wrapper is duplicated per-repo, not shared).

That issue's todo 3 explicitly left open: _"If GH Actions / promote-PR CI also runs this same QG step, confirm whether
CI runners see the same contention profile — if CI is single-tenant per run, the flake may be slot-worktree-specific
only."_ **This occurrence answers that question**: the failing run here was a hosted GH Actions `quality-gates-v2` job
(`30424080892`), not a local slot — so the 60s-timeout-under-contention pattern is NOT limited to local multi-slot
shared hosts. The likely mechanism differs slightly: `base-library.sh` sets `_PYTEST_N="auto"` when `GITHUB_ACTIONS` is
set (line 386-387), so GH Actions runs `pytest-xdist -n auto` — one worker per detected core, all sharing the runner's
CPU/IO. With 12125 tests fanned across `auto` workers, a genuinely-instant test can still be **descheduled** past the
60s wall-clock budget if a sibling worker on the same runner is CPU/IO-heavy at that moment — contention from sibling
xdist workers within the SAME job, rather than sibling jobs/slots on a shared host. Either way, the fix philosophy from
the precedent issue applies unchanged: raising (or making overridable) a **wall-clock** timeout that guards against
genuine hangs, to absorb realistic scheduling variance, is not "weakening" the check — the check's actual assertion
(cassette structural validity) is untouched; only the unrelated deadline is adjusted.

Unlike the precedent issue, the fix location here is **not** repo-local — `--timeout=60` lives once, in the SHARED
`unified-trading-pm/scripts/quality-gates-base/base-library.sh`, sourced by every repo's `scripts/quality-gates.sh`.
Editing it changes the pytest wall-clock budget workspace-wide in one commit — out of scope for a single-repo
`ldr_qg_failure` escalation response (which is bounded to fixing `$REPO` on its merits), and warranting the same
deliberate, tracked treatment the precedent issue gave its own (smaller-blast-radius) fix.

## Current state of the triggering wall

No unified-api-contracts action was needed for this specific occurrence: `live-defi-rollout` is already green — two
subsequent `quality-gates-v2` runs (`30429850246`, `30441849098`) both succeeded (content-sentinel skip: the tree state
after commits `d4045838`/`62d3aa03`/`3a8c845b`, from an unrelated slot's work, was already locally QG-verified before
those commits landed). The escalation's own repo-blocker list (`GET /api/repo-blockers`) had no open entry for
`unified-api-contracts` at investigation time.

## Todos

- [ ] 1. [INFRA] P2. In `unified-trading-pm/scripts/quality-gates-base/base-library.sh`, make the pytest `--timeout=`
      value follow the same override pattern as its `PYTEST_WORKERS`/`PYTEST_UNIT_DIR` neighbors on the same line block
      — e.g. `PYTEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS="${PYTEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:-60}"` feeding `--timeout=${PYTEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS}` —
      AND raise the workspace default to a value that absorbs realistic GH-Actions-xdist + shared-host scheduling
      variance (120-180s, per the precedent issue's 60→300 for the analogous `run_timeout`) without meaningfully
      delaying detection of a genuinely hung test. Verify on a real GH Actions `quality-gates-v2` run (not just local)
      since that is where this instance actually fired.
- [ ] 2. [INFRA] P3. Grep `unified-trading-pm/` + every repo's `scripts/quality-gates.sh` for other hardcoded wall-clock
      literals lacking an env-var override (pattern: `run_timeout <N>` / `--timeout=<N>` / similar) to check whether
      this "no override, unlike its sibling knobs" gap is a one-off or a recurring authoring pattern worth a lint rule.
- [ ] 3. [INFRA] P3. Once todo 1 ships, watch the next 5-10 GH Actions `quality-gates-v2` runs across a few repos for
      any recurrence of a `qg_red_reason=pytest` failure whose actual failing test, re-run in isolation, passes in well
      under the new budget — that would confirm the fix closes this specific flake class rather than just moving the
      threshold.

## Progress Log

- **2026-07-29** — Filed while resolving `ldr_qg_failure` escalation `agt-fa86c9` for `unified-api-contracts`
  (`f50defe3`). Diagnosis root-caused to `base-library.sh:391`'s hardcoded `--timeout=60`; confirmed via isolated 0.04s
  re-run of the specific failing test id. Did not fix inline — the fix location (`unified-trading-pm`'s shared QG
  library) is outside the escalation's target repo (`unified-api-contracts`) and workspace-wide in blast radius, so it
  needs the same dedicated, tracked treatment the precedent issue gave its narrower fix. No code change needed on
  `unified-api-contracts` itself — LDR was already green by the time of investigation (content-sentinel-verified).
