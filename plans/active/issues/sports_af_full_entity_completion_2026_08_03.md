title:
  Full API-Football entity completion — every AF entity at its correct scope, so the API-Football plan can be downgraded
summary: >-
  Operator directive (2026-08-03): the sports satellite campaign's docs/plans must in aggregate cover EVERY API-Football
  (AF) entity without exception — all-383-league entities fully at 383, MVP-scoped entities fully at 96 — not just the 3
  entities (FIXTURE_EVENTS/FIXTURE_STATS/FIXTURE_LINEUPS) already tracked in
  `sports_fixture_events_refetch_progress_2026_07_25.md`. Explicit business goal: once genuinely complete, the operator
  wants to downgrade the API-Football subscription tier, so full completion here is the actual deliverable, not just
  data-quality hygiene. Censused the 5 previously-untracked AF entities (PLAYER_STATS/INJURIES/STANDINGS/TEAMS/LEAGUES)
  against their own SPORTS_ENTITY_LEAGUE_COVERAGE scope — 4 of the 5 show substantial genuine gaps (270,873 total needed
  shards across PLAYER_STATS/INJURIES/STANDINGS/TEAMS), plausibly explained by the SAME unconditional-MVP-pre-filter bug
  already found + fixed this session (todo #3, `instruments-service` per-fixture task-queueing loop) — these entities
  were already declared `None` (all-383) in the coverage dict from day one, but the actual fetch loop silently capped
  them to MVP-96 until that fix landed. **LEAGUES resolved 2026-08-03**: its initial 110,290-shard "gap" was a
  census-script artifact — the entity's daily write path was retired 2026-05-07 (replaced by code-committed UAC static
  data), confirmed via a live manifest spot-check; zero genuine work remains for LEAGUES.

## Why this doc exists (not folded into the parent plan or the FIXTURE_EVENTS issue doc)

`sports_satellite_ao_dispatch_batch2_2026_07_24.md` is at 996/1000 lines (hard cap) — no room to add this scope there.
`sports_fixture_events_refetch_progress_2026_07_25.md` is at 897 lines and scoped specifically to FIXTURE_EVENTS — this
is a genuinely broader initiative (5 more entities, ~381k shards, a different completion criterion: "every AF entity
done" rather than "one entity's non-canonical count converges to 0"). Both existing docs are `related:` linked here.

## The operator's actual ask (verbatim intent, 2026-08-03)

"Ensure the docs/plans/issues you are going through in aggregate will do everything AF related without exception, so
that's finally done for all leagues where relevant and MVP-only leagues where relevant. Means we can then downgrade
API-Football." — i.e., this is not an open-ended data-quality nice-to-have; there is a concrete downstream action
(reducing vendor spend) gated on this campaign's genuine completion. Every AF entity, at its correct scope, or this doc
does not close.

Denominator = distinct `(date, league_id)` pairs with a captured `FIXTURES`/`FIXTURES_SCHEDULE` row (a genuine fixture
existed that day), intersected with each entity's own `get_entity_league_coverage()` scope — mirrors
`emit_empty_gaps_for_entity`'s own expected-set logic (`sports_reference_core.py:338-341`), so "needed" here means the
same gap the writer's own empty-gap emission targets, not an invented denominator. Full census:
`instruments-service/scripts/census_all_af_entities_completion_2026_08_03.py` (single UTL-client manifest read, same
credential-safe pattern as the fixed `census_fixture_events_schema_variants_2026_07_25.py`).

**Grand total needed across the 4 in-scope entities: 270,873 shards** (PLAYER_STATS+INJURIES+STANDINGS+TEAMS; LEAGUES
excluded per the resolved verdict below — confirmed unchanged for the other 4 after the LEAGUES manifest flip below).

## ✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-03 — LEAGUES verdict: retired entity, 0 real work, do not launch

Two independent investigations converged on the same verdict (a dispatched Explore agent's code/GCS read, and a separate
live-manifest + retirement-commit check) — **measurement artifact, LEAGUES is not in scope at all.**

1. **The writer path was killed 2026-05-07** — `git show 93efebf3`
   (`feat(orchestrator)!: retire api_football LEAGUES daily-dump (C.1)`) confirms the pre-retirement cadence explicitly:
   "was 3046 daily shards of **identical static league refdata**" — so LEAGUES genuinely WAS written per-(date,league)
   historically (not per-season), but every date's shard held redundant, unchanging content, which is why the fix was
   full retirement rather than switching to a coarser cadence. `sports_reference.py:134-146` documents the replacement:
   UAC `LeagueDefinition` + `provider_league_ids` (`FOOTYSTATS_SEASON_IDS`, `FOOTYSTATS_HISTORICAL_SEASON_IDS`, etc.)
   canonicalise league metadata via **code commits at season start**, not a daily GCS dump — the api_football `/leagues`
   endpoint has not been called from the daily orchestrator since. `process_preflight.py:54-61` confirms LEAGUES was
   removed from `_SPORTS_CORE_ENTITIES` the same day. No downstream consumer regressed (features-sports'
   `LEAGUES_COLUMNS` was schema-only, no feature ever read `logo_url` etc. beyond what UAC already provides).
2. **The shard atom never had a `league_id` axis to begin with** —
   `unified-api-contracts/.../canonical/domain/sports/gcs_paths.py:186` declares
   `"LEAGUES": SportsPathLayout.PER_DAY_BARE` (no `league=` path segment), and
   `codex/02-data/sports-gcs-path-ssot.md:115` states outright that LEAGUES is "cross-league reference data where
   `league_id` grouping has no meaning." A per-`(date, league_id)` denominator was categorically invalid for this entity
   — max theoretical shards was ~2,200 days, not 110,739. GCS confirms deletion too: sampled 5 dates across 2021–2026
   under `pipeline_mode=batch_api_football/`, zero `entity=leagues/` objects in any of them.
3. **Root cause of the false 110,290/449 "needed"/"captured" figures — a genuine bug, now fixed and applied**:
   `scripts/migrate_leagues_kill_2026_05_07.py` (the sanctioned, idempotent flip-to-`empty_confirmed` migration for
   exactly this retirement) hardcoded `SPORTS_BUCKET = f"instruments-store-sports-{PROJECT_ID}"` — missing the `-prd-`
   env infix — so it 404'd every single time it was ever run, silently, since 2026-05-07. It had **never once
   succeeded**; all 8,780 `data_type=LEAGUES` manifest rows were still stuck at `capture_status=captured` right up until
   this session. Fixed to use `resolve_bucket_name(cloud="gcp", kind="instruments-store", asset_group="sports")`
   - the UTL `get_storage_client()`/`upload_bytes` pattern (was inlining `google.cloud.storage` directly). Re-ran
     scan-only (confirmed 8,780 stale `captured` rows, not 449 — this doc's own census script's 449 figure was itself an
     undercount, since it only counted rows that also matched a captured-fixture date), then `--apply`'d with
     `MANIFEST_PER_VM_SHARDS=true VM_NAME=migrate-leagues-kill-finish-20260803` (CSV-audited — this is a manifest-only
     flip, NOT the separate operator-gated `gcloud storage rm -r .../entity=leagues/` GCS-object deletion, which remains
     untouched and still requires the operator). A follow-up live-manifest read (independently, by the second
     investigation) confirms all 8,780 rows now show `capture_status=empty_confirmed` +
     `error_reason=EXPECTED_DEPRECATED_DATA_TYPE`, zero `captured` remaining — the migration is genuinely applied, not
     just written. Shipped as `instruments-service@5db692db`.
4. Also dropped `"LEAGUES": False` from `census_all_af_entities_completion_2026_08_03.py`'s `ENTITIES` dict (it was
   censusing a retired data_type against an inapplicable denominator, and never checked for
   `empty_confirmed`/`EXPECTED_DEPRECATED_DATA_TYPE` — so it silently treated every fixture-day as still needing a
   LEAGUES capture) — re-ran, confirmed the other 4 entities' numbers are byte-for-byte unchanged (270,873 = 381,163 −
   110,290 exactly, so nothing else was touched by the flip).

**Residual, non-blocking (not this doc's scope, noted for whoever next touches sports config)**:
`SPORTS_ENTITY_LEAGUE_COVERAGE["LEAGUES"] = None` and `SPORTS_ENTITY_START_DATES["LEAGUES"] = "2019-01-01"` in
`provider_league_ids.py` are stale leftovers from before the 2026-05-07 retirement — they actively mislead any future
census/tooling into treating LEAGUES as a live all-383 entity (as they did here). Worth a follow-up cleanup PR in UAC,
not urgent enough to block this campaign.

## ⚠️ Caveat still open for the 4 in-scope entities

1. **The "needed shards → API calls" conversion is UNKNOWN for TEAMS/STANDINGS/INJURIES.** The 4.5875-fixtures-per-shard
   ratio used to estimate FIXTURE_STATS/LINEUPS/EVENTS call volume was derived from FIXTURE_EVENTS specifically (a
   genuinely per-fixture entity — one event-list call per match). TEAMS is observed in logs as one call per **league**
   (`Fetched 20 teams for league=39 season=2025`), not per fixture — so a single API call likely satisfies MANY
   `(date, league)` shard-rows at once (every date that league had a fixture inherits the same team-roster fetch). **Do
   not multiply TEAMS' needed-shard count by 4.5875** — that would badly overstate its real API-call cost.
   INJURIES/STANDINGS are more plausibly per-fixture-date already (injury reports and standings snapshots genuinely
   change match-to-match), closer to the FIXTURE_EVENTS model, but this is also unverified. (This is the same
   LEAGUES-shaped trap the resolved verdict above just caught — worth actually checking before launching, not assuming.)

## Todos

- [x] ✅ [SCRIPT] P1. **Spot-check LEAGUES' real write cadence** — **RESOLVED 2026-08-03**: LEAGUES daily-dump write
      path retired 2026-05-07 (`instruments-service@93efebf3`), replaced by code-committed UAC static data. Root cause
      of the 110,290/449 false figures found + fixed: `migrate_leagues_kill_2026_05_07.py`'s hardcoded bucket name
      (`instruments-service@5db692db`); applied, confirmed via live manifest read (all 8,780 LEAGUES rows =
      `empty_confirmed`/`EXPECTED_DEPRECATED_DATA_TYPE`, zero `captured`). Census script corrected to 4 entities. Not in
      scope, no LEAGUES backfill will be launched. See "RESOLVED" section above.
- [x] ✅ [SCRIPT] P1. **Launch FIXTURE_STATS all-leagues backfill** — CONFIRMED RUNNING 2026-08-03: VM
      `af-backfill-20260803-233053` (launched by `unified-trading-sa`, `purpose=api-football-backfill`,
      `managed-by=deployment-service`), metadata confirms
      `entity=FIXTURE_STATS source=API_FOOTBALL     start_date=2020-06-06`. FIXTURE_EVENTS pass-3 singleton lock had
      cleared (it is the only `af-backfill-*`/ `af-audit-*` VM RUNNING — the prior three are TERMINATED). `run.log`
      shows healthy per-fixture progress (`[[VM_PROGRESS]] last_completed_date=2020-06-13→2020-06-14`, manifest writes,
      correct rate-limit backoff handling). No duplicate VM launched — a second concurrent AF-consuming VM would violate
      the shared singleton lock / quota.
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P1. **Launch FIXTURE_LINEUPS all-leagues backfill** the same way, after FIXTURE_STATS converges.
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P1. **Launch PLAYER_STATS MVP-96 backfill** (`--entity PLAYER_STATS 2020-06-06 <today>`) once the
      singleton lock frees up — 17,440 needed shards, same MVP scope as FIXTURE_EVENTS (worth checking this entity's
      census script for the SAME fixture_id/af_fixture_id column bug already found + fixed in the FIXTURE_EVENTS census,
      if a dedicated recovery-style census is ever built for it).
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P2. **Launch INJURIES all-leagues backfill** (100,745 needed shards) — likely per-fixture-date cadence,
      apply the daily stop/resume discipline.
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P2. **Launch STANDINGS all-leagues backfill** (84,947 needed shards) — same discipline.
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P2. **Launch TEAMS all-leagues backfill** (67,741 needed shards, BUT likely 1 call/league not 1
      call/shard — confirm real call cost before estimating timeline; may complete far faster than the shard count
      implies).
- [x] ✅ [SCRIPT] P2. ~~Launch LEAGUES all-leagues backfill~~ — NOT APPLICABLE, resolved above: LEAGUES is a retired
      entity (no write path since 2026-05-07); there is nothing to launch. Excluded from this campaign's remaining scope
      and from the grand-total needed count (270,873 across the 4 still-live entities).
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P0. **Re-census the 8 in-scope entities once every backfill above completes** (FIXTURES, FIXTURE_EVENTS,
      FIXTURE_STATS, FIXTURE_LINEUPS, PLAYER_STATS, INJURIES, STANDINGS, TEAMS — LEAGUES permanently excluded, resolved
      above), confirm every needed-count converges to ~0 (accounting for genuine honest-absence floors per entity, same
      pattern as FIXTURE_EVENTS' ~1,943-stub floor), and only then close this doc + notify the operator the full AF
      completion is genuinely done and the API-Football plan can be downgraded.

## Sequencing note

All of these share the SAME `af-backfill-*`/`af-audit-*` singleton lock (one API-Football-consuming VM at a time, shared
daily quota) as the already-in-flight FIXTURE_EVENTS pass-3 and the queued FIXTURE_STATS/FIXTURE_LINEUPS work — this is
a genuinely sequential, multi-day-to-multi-week campaign, not something to parallelize across VMs. Priority order above
(P1 before P2) reflects: entities already declared as "widened this session" (FIXTURE_STATS/LINEUPS/ PLAYER_STATS)
before the newly-discovered-but-not-yet-widened-in-conversation entities (INJURIES/STANDINGS/TEAMS/ LEAGUES), though all
are genuinely in scope for the operator's "no exceptions" directive.

## Progress Log

- **2026-08-03 (main agt-1756f6)** — Blocked-queue Q **BLK-169e1207** (slot 12, task
  `sports_af_full_entity_completion-003` = "Launch FIXTURE_LINEUPS all-leagues backfill") answered **A: do NOT launch
  now**. The worker correctly caught a **premature-dispatch**: FIXTURE_LINEUPS is gated on "after FIXTURE_STATS
  converges" (todo above), but FIXTURE_STATS (`af-backfill-20260803-233053`) had only started ~10 min earlier (69,171
  shards, multi-day) and was the sole RUNNING AF VM. Launching FIXTURE_LINEUPS then would have run a 2nd concurrent AF
  VM against the **shared singleton lock / one API-Football daily quota** (the Sequencing note above), violating the
  lock. Instructed `skip-current-task` (returns to queue).
- **Recurring risk flagged (durable fix needed, not yet done)**: the launch todos here are serialized only by
  `sequential:true`, which encodes **dispatch order, NOT the real convergence gate**. So each launch todo redispatches
  the instant the prior one _completes_ (i.e. the prior VM _launches_ / its dispatch finishes), not when the prior
  entity's backfill actually _converges_ (census == 0 needed) and frees the singleton lock. Any slot that next claims a
  launch todo will hit the same trap. **Proper fix**: gate each launch todo on a real prerequisite keyed to the prior
  entity's census-0 / lock-free state (a `depends_on` prerequisite the backend actually blocks on, or park the
  downstream launch todos until an operator/worker confirms the prior AF VM finished), rather than relying on dispatch
  ordering. Until then, any worker dispatched a `Launch <ENTITY> backfill` todo here MUST first verify no other
  `af-backfill-*`/`af-audit-*` VM is RUNNING (singleton lock free) and that the immediately-prior entity's census shows
  ~0 needed — if not, `skip-current-task` and it requeues (do NOT launch a 2nd concurrent AF VM).
- **2026-08-04 (slot 4)** — Dispatched the same `sports_af_full_entity_completion-003` (Launch FIXTURE_LINEUPS) todo.
  Re-verified the gate per the risk note above: singleton lock was FREE (no `af-backfill-*`/`af-audit-*` VM RUNNING —
  confirmed via `gcloud compute instances list`), but FIXTURE_STATS had **not converged**: re-ran
  `census_fixture_stats_lineups_widening_volume_2026_07_31.py`, which showed only 125/68,409 non-MVP shards captured
  (0.18%) — essentially unchanged from launch. Root cause: the prior FIXTURE_STATS VM (`af-backfill-20260803-233053`)
  was **SPOT-preempted ~17 min after launch** (audit log: `compute.instances.preempted` at 2026-08-03T23:47-48Z, ~16 min
  after the 23:31 `instances.insert`) and **never auto-resumed** — the VM no longer exists at all (not even TERMINATED
  in the instance list), and no successor `af-backfill-*` VM was ever launched. This is exactly the class the codex HARD
  RULE "preemption recovery must resume from measured PROGRESS, never replay START_DATE" exists for
  (`/codex/05-infrastructure/vm-launcher-runbook.md` § Tardis/backfill preemption); the
  `exit_code_fleet_monitor`/`RelaunchPreemptedVm` auto-recovery apparently did not fire for this VM (worth a follow-up
  look at why, not chased further here — out of this doc's scope). **Action taken**: relaunched FIXTURE_STATS as
  `af-backfill-20260804-001203` (`launch-api-football-backfill-vm.sh --entity FIXTURE_STATS 2020-06-06 2026-08-04`,
  SPOT, idempotent skip-if-captured — no `--force`, so this is a safe resume, not a redo_all). Verified healthy at
  T+~4min: `run.log` shows genuine per-fixture FIXTURE_STATS fetches (`Fetched 2 stat rows for fixture=...`), correct
  skip-already-captured + observed-out-of-coverage handling, and correct 429 rate-limit backoff — not a crash-loop.
  **FIXTURE_LINEUPS remains blocked** — its gate ("after FIXTURE_STATS converges") is still unmet; did NOT launch it.
  `skip-current-task`'d `sports_af_full_entity_completion-003` again so it requeues once FIXTURE_STATS genuinely
  converges. The durable fix flagged above (a real `depends_on` convergence gate instead of dispatch-order
  `sequential:true`) is still not implemented — a future worker will hit this same trap a third time until it is; not
  fixed in this session (outside this task's scope, flagging again for whoever next touches plan authoring for this
  campaign).
