title:
  Fleet-wide QG self-hosted-runner capacity crisis (fleet_wide_qg_self_hosted_runner_capacity_crisis_2026_07_27.md) is
  still active into a second day — that doc hit its 1000-line hard cap so this is a continuation, not a duplicate
summary: >-
  Responding to an operator #ci-failures Slack dump (2026-07-28 22:40-2026-07-29 01:29 BST) asking whether the flood of
  QG FAILED/RECOVERED flapping, sit-unlock failures, and stuck promotion PRs indicates an ongoing unresolved problem:
  **yes, confirmed live via the AO escalation API** (`GET /api/escalations/active`, SSM against `i-0c9b283b31d6b5ca7`),
  not assumed from the Slack dump alone. As of 2026-07-29T01:05-01:08Z: 47 `ldr_qg_failure` escalations active in the
  trailing 6h window across ~30 repos, of which 6 terminated `still_red_past_deadline` (genuine give-ups, not fixed —
  including `market-tick-data-service` at 46 attempts and `trading-agent-service` at 78 attempts before eventually going
  green) and several more actively re-escalating (`still_red_reescalated`) in a live retry loop at query time
  (`instruments-service`, `e2e-testing` twice). This is the exact same root cause
  `fleet_wide_qg_self_hosted_runner_capacity_crisis_2026_07_27.md` has tracked since 2026-07-27 — shared 16-vCPU/32GB
  box `i-0c9b283b31d6b5ca7` oversubscribed by ~13-20 concurrent AO slot-worker sessions plus up to 22 self-hosted CI
  runner pools — but that doc is now at its 1000-line hard cap (`wc -l` = exactly 1000) and cannot take a new Progress
  Log entry, hence this continuation doc rather than appending. Separately, and NOT yet diagnosed in the original doc:
  `unified-trading-pm`'s own `plan_health` escalation queue (a DIFFERENT `wall_type`, not `ldr_qg_failure`) is actively
  GROWING, not draining — 44 active `plan_health` entries at query time (was ~34 per the operator's own dashboard
  screenshot earlier the same session), spanning 12 distinct promote-PR incarnations (#1740-#1751) in roughly 5 hours,
  every one `status=dispatched`/`resolved_at=null`. The specific trio the operator asked to be watched (PR
  #1746/#1747/#1748, escalation ids `agt-6a6ba6`/`agt-4c0ede`/`agt-4de402`) had NOT cleared as of this check: all three
  still `status=dispatched`, `resolved_at=null`, 44-51 minutes elapsed since their own dispatch (past the 30-40min
  window originally asked about) — and 4 newer PM promote PRs (#1748-#1751) had already queued up behind them in the
  same window, consistent with a queue that isn't keeping pace with its own inflow rather than one that's merely slow.

# Fleet-wide QG capacity crisis continues into day 2 (2026-07-29) — original doc at line cap

## Why this doc exists instead of an entry in the original

`fleet_wide_qg_self_hosted_runner_capacity_crisis_2026_07_27.md` is at exactly 1000 lines (the hard cap enforced by
`check_line_caps.sh`) — confirmed via `wc -l` before attempting to append. That doc's own root-cause analysis, timeline,
and the operator's 2026-07-28 "protected-6 repos stay self-hosted, accept recurring reds, resolve via retrigger" ruling
all still stand; nothing here supersedes them. This is a same-root-cause continuation entry that had nowhere to land.

## Live verification, 2026-07-29 ~01:05-01:08Z (via AO `GET /api/escalations/active`, SSM)

**`ldr_qg_failure` wall_type, 6h trailing window, 47 entries across ~30 repos:**

- 6 terminated `still_red_past_deadline` (genuine unresolved failures, not fixed): `instruments-service`#1007 (3
  attempts), `agent-orchestrator`#0 (3 attempts), `features-service`#893 (8 attempts), `market-tick-data-service`#774 (2
  attempts), `trading-agent-service`#363 (10 attempts), `market-tick-data-service`#0 (**46 attempts**).
- 1 resolved `qg_v2_green` only after **78 attempts** (`trading-agent-service`#364).
- At query time, several still actively re-escalating (`still_red_reescalated`, i.e. genuinely red again, looped back
  into a fresh dispatch cycle rather than terminally given up): `instruments-service` (×2 rows, one immediately
  re-dispatched), `e2e-testing` (×2 rows).
- Remainder either genuinely `qg_v2_green` (real fixes/self-heals) or still `dispatched` mid-flight.

**This matches `fleet_wide_qg_self_hosted_runner_capacity_crisis_2026_07_27.md`'s signature exactly** — the doc's last
logged entry was 2026-07-28 ~23:26Z (`instruments-service`#1007, `uv` cache race + typecheck timeout + duration miss,
confirmed non-code via clean local QG at the same HEAD); this check ~2h later shows the identical pattern continuing,
unabated, into 2026-07-29.

**`plan_health` wall_type on `unified-trading-pm` specifically — NOT covered by the original doc, distinct symptom:**

44 active entries at query time (`now=2026-07-29T01:05:17Z`), all `status=dispatched`, all `resolved_at=null`, spanning
promote-PR incarnations #1740 through #1751 (12 PRs in ~5h — i.e. a fresh promote PR roughly every 25min, consistent
with `ldr-to-main-promote-fleet.yml`'s `*/15` cadence plus PM being an unusually active repo). The operator-flagged
trio:

| escalation_id | PR   | created (UTC) | dispatched (UTC) | status     | resolved_at | elapsed since dispatch |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| `agt-6a6ba6`  | 1746 | 23:34:02      | 00:17:38         | dispatched | null        | ~51min                 |
| `agt-4c0ede`  | 1747 | 23:41:07      | 00:18:37         | dispatched | null        | ~50min                 |
| `agt-4de402`  | 1748 | 23:51:17      | 00:21:04         | dispatched | null        | ~47min                 |

**Answer to the operator's direct ask: no, this trio had not cleared within 30-40min — nor within the ~50min this check
ran at.** Whether `plan_health` escalations on PM are being starved by the same host-contention root cause (a
`plan_health` worker is presumably itself a slot session competing for the same oversubscribed box) or have a separate,
undiagnosed bottleneck is **not yet determined** — flagging as open rather than assuming either.

## Why this matters for the original CI-cost-reduction thread

This session's original mandate was auditing/reducing GH Actions spend (~$1,150-1,200/mo baseline measured 2026-07-15).
A `trading-agent-service` PR needing **78 retry attempts** before going green, and a `market-tick-data-service`
escalation racking up **46 attempts** before giving up entirely, represent exactly the kind of CI-minute waste that
audit was meant to catch — except this waste is _retry churn from host contention_, not from slow tests or heavy
libraries. The self-hosted-runner migration (this session's own earlier fix, intended to CUT GH-hosted-minute spend) is
the proximate trigger: it moved CI load onto a box that can't sustain it, and the resulting retry storm may be burning
more wall-clock/compute (on infra you're already paying for) than the GH minutes it saved. This is worth quantifying,
not just noting.

## Todos

- [ ] [DATA] P1. Quantify actual cost impact: pull attempt-count distribution across all `ldr_qg_failure` escalations
      over the incident's full 2026-07-27→present window (not just the 6h sample here) and estimate GH-Actions-minute
      waste from cancelled/timed-out/retried runs vs. the self-hosted migration's original projected savings — the
      operator asked for this audit's numbers to be real, not assumed.
- [ ] [OPERATOR] P1. Revisit the 2026-07-28 "protected-6 stay self-hosted, accept recurring reds, resolve via retrigger"
      posture now that it has run into a second day with a 46-attempt and a 78-attempt case — the original doc's own
      Progress Log flagged this exact question ("worth an urgent re-look... rather than treating each new instance as
      just another routine corroboration") before hitting its line cap; it was never answered.
- [ ] [BACKEND] P2. Diagnose whether PM's `plan_health` escalation queue (44 active, growing, none resolving) shares the
      `ldr_qg_failure` box-contention root cause or has an independent bottleneck — check whether a `plan_health` worker
      type is actually being spawned/claiming slots at all, vs. queuing indefinitely for lack of a matching worker (a
      distinct failure mode from "slow due to contention").
- [ ] [SCRIPT] P2. Once `fleet_wide_qg_self_hosted_runner_capacity_crisis_2026_07_27.md`'s Recommended-fix-path section
      is next revisited, consider splitting that doc (archive the day-1 Progress Log, keep an active continuation) so
      future corroborations have somewhere to land instead of spawning sibling docs like this one.

## Evidence

- Live query: `GET http://localhost:8765/api/escalations/active?include_resolved_within_hours=6` via SSM against
  `i-0c9b283b31d6b5ca7`, 2026-07-29T01:05:17Z and T01:08Z snapshots (raw JSON captured in this session's tool output,
  not reproduced here in full — re-run the same query for a fresh sample).
- Original doc: `/plans/active/issues/fleet_wide_qg_self_hosted_runner_capacity_crisis_2026_07_27.md` (1000 lines, at
  cap as of this writing).
