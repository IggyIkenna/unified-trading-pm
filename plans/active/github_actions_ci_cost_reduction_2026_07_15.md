title:
  GitHub Actions CI/CD cost reduction — self-host the glue, kill the minute-minimum tax, fix cron cadence (DRAFT /
  suggestions)
summary: >-
  PM is ~48% of a ~$1,000/mo GitHub Actions bill despite a code freeze because it is the fleet CI/CD control tower —
  ~79% of its runs are automation (status routing, deploy dispatch, promotion/health crons), only ~8% are doc commits.
  All repos are private (every minute billed) and there are ZERO self-hosted runners, so the biggest untapped lever is
  moving lightweight glue off $0.008/min GitHub-hosted runners onto compute we already run 24/7. This plan proposes a
  tiered fix — self-host the switchboard+crons, collapse the quality-gates job fan-out that pays a 1-min minimum per
  sub-second job, retire a duplicate promote bot + slow crons, and (later) move ci-status-update to a serverless write.
  THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS FOR REVIEW, NOT FINAL DECISIONS — nothing here is approved to execute yet.

# GitHub Actions CI/CD cost reduction — proposal (DRAFT)

> **⚠️ THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS, NOT FINAL DECISIONS.** This plan is `status: draft` and **human-only** (`assigned_vm: NA`,
> `execution_scope: local-only`) — it will **not** be ingested or dispatched to any agent. It exists to lay out the
> options and evidence so the operator can decide **which, if any,** of these changes to make and in what order. No
> workflow, runner, or infra change below is approved to execute. Flip individual items to real todos (and the plan to
> `active`) only after an explicit operator ruling on the open questions in § "Decisions needed".

## Why we are spending the money (evidence)

Pulled from the **live GitHub Enhanced-Billing ledger** (not estimates) via the existing `github-billing-token`:

- **100% of spend is Actions Linux compute minutes** — not storage, not packages, not Copilot.
- **June net $1,441 · July (1–15) net $485**
  (~$1,000/mo run-rate). Daily figures matched the operator's memory exactly
  (Jul 13 = $82, Jul 14 = $77).
- **PM is the single biggest repo — 35% of spend in June, rising to ~48% in July.**
- PM produced **1,000 workflow runs in a 13.5-hour window (~1,778/day)** during a code freeze. Trigger mix by billed
  share: **repository_dispatch 55% · schedule 18% · pull_request 13% · push 8% · workflow_dispatch 6%.** → **~79%
  automation, ~21% code, and only ~8% is PM's own commits.**
- All repos are **private** (every minute billed; public would be free) and there are **zero self-hosted runners**
  registered — the cheapest lever is completely untapped.

**Root cause:** PM is not expensive because it is a docs repo. It is the **CI/CD control tower** — every repo's CI
dispatches status/build/deploy jobs _into_ PM, and PM runs the fleet's promotion/health cron machinery. The cost is the
switchboard traffic + the timer-driven bots, both of which boot a full `ubuntu-latest` VM for lightweight glue.

### Top cost drivers in PM (13.5h sample, by est. billed-minute share)

| Workflow                      | Share | Trigger              | What it does                                                                                                                        | Assessment                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ci-status-update`            | ~33%  | repository_dispatch  | Boots a 2-job VM every ~2.5 min to write ONE Firestore CI-status row for whichever repo just finished CI                            | Purpose right, mechanism ~100× too heavy     |
| `cloud-build-router` + `-aws` | ~20%  | repository_dispatch  | Routes a "QG passed → go build/deploy" dispatch to GCP + AWS, 3 jobs each, both fire on every green                                 | Fires even in freeze when nothing deploys    |
| `quality-gates-v2`            | ~18%  | pull_request         | The real tests/lint/typecheck — but splits into 5–7 jobs, each billed a 1-min minimum (9s "content sentinel" = 1 full min)          | Legit compute, inflated ~3× by fan-out       |
| promotion + health crons      | ~18%  | schedule (_/15–_/30) | `ldr-to-main-promote`, `-fleet`, `staging-to-main`, `branch-health`, `ci-health` — poll "anything to ship/any failures?" on a clock | Real safety nets; over-frequent + duplicated |

## Guiding principle

**GitHub-hosted runners are for running _tests_ in a clean throwaway box. Stop using them as the always-on _plumbing_
for status-writing, dispatch-routing, PR-opening, and health-polling.** That glue should run on compute we already pay
for 24/7 (self-hosted runner minutes are free from GitHub's side), or not boot a VM at all. Because every repo is
**private, there are no untrusted fork PRs**, so self-hosted runners are safe here even for PR-triggered workflows —
though we still keep heavy test jobs on hosted runners to avoid loading our own VMs.

---

## Proposed work (SUGGESTIONS — each is a decision, not a commitment)

### Phase 0 — Make the case airtight (do this first, low-risk, read-only)

- [x] ✅ [MEASURE] P1. Pull the **full 4-month (Apr–Jul 2026)** billed attribution + a 30-day per-workflow breakdown —
      DONE 2026-07-15. Results written to the companion doc §"Audit results — April–July 2026" (fleet monthly totals,
      per-repo 4-mo matrix, PM per-workflow + per-cluster). Key: fleet ~$1,000/mo steady-state (Jun peak $1,441, Apr
      ~$0
      pre-machinery); PM $808/4mo = 39% (share climbing to 47.7% in Jul); PM clusters ci-status-update 32% /
      promotion-health-bots 28% / quality-gates-v2 20% / agent-plan bots 13.5% / routers 5% (router **corrected DOWN**
      from the 13.5h sample's ~20%).
- [x] ✅ [MEASURE] P1. Confirm fleet-wide **zero self-hosted runners** + baseline — DONE 2026-07-15: `actions/runners`
      total_count = 0; rate $0.006/min; baseline = ~$1,000/mo fleet / ~$480–510/mo PM (the number the fixes are measured
      against). Evidence in the companion doc §"Audit results".

### Phase 1 — Self-host the switchboard + cron glue (biggest win, ~70% of PM)

- [x] ✅ [OPERATOR-DECISION] P1. **Runner host DECIDED (operator 2026-07-15): the planning-VM** (central orchestrator,
      `i-0c9b283b31d6b5ca7`, m8i.2xlarge 8vCPU/32GB). Capacity verified: glue ~1.7 cores avg vs ~7 idle; fits with a CPU
      cap. See companion doc §"Capacity assessment".
- [x] ✅ [INFRA] P1. **Runner infra files AUTHORED 2026-07-15** (created locally, NOT yet deployed) —
      `scripts/self-hosted-runners/`: `setup-glue-runners.sh` (install/status/teardown/prune), `glue-runner-run.sh`
      (JIT-ephemeral wrapper), `github-glue-runner@.service` + `.slice` (CPUQuota≤400% / MemoryMax 8G to protect AO),
      `classify-glue-workflows.sh`, `README.md` (runbook). Runner pinned **v2.335.1** + sha256; PAT can register (JIT
      verified); all glue is in PM so **repo-scoped runners**, no per-repo fan-out. shellcheck-clean. **Deploy step
      pending operator go** (run `setup-glue-runners.sh install` on the VM with an admin PAT).
- [ ] [REVIEW] P1. **Security gate:** the `classify-glue-workflows.sh` split is **52 MOVE / 4 KEEP** — KEEP =
      `quality-gates-v2`, `python-quality-gates-v2` (CPU-bound tests, stay hosted), + the two `pull_request` agent bots
      (`plan-health-agent`, `conflict-resolution-merged`). Confirm the MOVE set carries no untrusted fork-PR code
      (private repo → none) before flipping.
- [ ] [INFRA] P1. **STEP 2 — flip `runs-on`** on the MOVE set only (`ubuntu-latest` → `[self-hosted, glue]`), via the
      template SSOT + `rollout-workflow-templates.sh`. **Pace = canary → phased groups (operator 2026-07-15):** flip ONE
      low-risk workflow first (`branch-health` or `reconcile-release-tags`), confirm a green self-hosted run, then roll
      the remaining 52 MOVE workflows out in **small batches** (not all at once). (Takes effect on push — do NOT push
      until the runners are live on the VM, else those workflows queue with no runner.)
- [ ] [VERIFY] P1. After 3–5 days, re-measure PM's billed minutes (ledger); confirm the moved workflows bill ~$0 and the
      VM absorbed the load without contention (slice `MemoryCurrent` < 8G, orchestrator load unaffected).

### Phase 2 — Shrink the fleet-wide hosted QG (the real $ that stays on GitHub-hosted: A1 + A2 + A5)

> These three touch the shared reusable `python-quality-gates-v2.yml` (44 callers, all ~25 repos) → fleet-wide savings.
> QG is the ADR-sensitive gate — no coverage loss, green-only guards.

- [ ] [INFRA] P1. **A1 — docs-only fast-path (operator: do it).** Extend the committed-diff check
      (`python-quality-gates-v2.yml` L170-202 / L585-607) to the `base-service.sh:596` docs regex so a pure
      docs/plans/codex change skips the ~12-min pytest+typecheck legs (keep lint-codex). Scope: `plans/**`+`codex/**`
      IN, lockfiles/workflow-YAML OUT. Also gate `dispatch-cloud-build` on `docs_only!='true'`.
- [ ] [INFRA] P1. **A2 — FIX the content-gate dedup properly (operator: fix now).** Rebuild the byte-identical-tree skip
      on the **Firestore tree-fingerprints** (replace the broken `actions/cache` at L90-137 / L647-653). **Correctness
      guard: skip ONLY when that exact tree previously passed GREEN** (never off a failed/unknown run); relies on QG
      determinism. Fleet-wide (does NOT touch SIT; never skips a changed tree).
- [ ] [INFRA] P2. **A5 — collapse the fan-out (operator: measure-then-collapse).** Confirm the merged
      `typecheck`+`lint-codex` leg stays under the pytest leg on the slowest repo, then merge + fold the sub-minute jobs
      (content-sentinel/Slack/dispatch). Target ~30–40% fewer billed job-minutes/run, no coverage loss.
- [ ] [VERIFY] P2. Re-measure a representative QG run's billed job-minutes + the docs-PR / identical-tree skip rates
      before/after (ledger + run counts).

### Phase 3 — Cadence + de-duplication (cheap wins)

- [x] ✅ [OPERATOR-DECISION] P2. **Promote bots — KEEP BOTH (operator 2026-07-15; "retire duplicate" WITHDRAWN).**
      Re-inspection: `ldr-to-main-promote` is **PM-only** and `ldr-to-main-promote-fleet` serves the **23 `ldr_main`
      repos** (PM excluded, `promotion_model` unset) — disjoint scopes, complementary, NOT duplicates. Optional future
      consolidation only (moot once self-hosted at $0).
- [ ] [INFRA] P2. Slow promotion/health crons from `*/15` toward **hourly** (or purely event-driven off the promotion PR
      event) during freeze; keep the event path for real-time needs. Lower priority once these are on self-hosted, but
      fewer idle boots is cleaner regardless.
- [ ] [INFRA] P3. **Debounce `ci-status-update`** — coalesce multiple repo reports arriving within a short window into
      one write instead of N runner boots (careful to preserve the CAS + stale-write ordering the Firestore store relies
      on).

### Phase 4 — (Later / optional) Move ci-status-update off Actions entirely

- [ ] [OPERATOR-DECISION] P3. Decide whether to go further than self-hosting for the busiest workflow: wrap the existing
      `scripts/cicd/ci_status_store.py` write logic in a small **Cloud Run / Cloud Function** endpoint and have each
      repo's CI POST directly, removing the Actions run (and its checkout) entirely. Folds into Phase 1's savings but
      removes VM load + cuts latency ~30s→~1s. Medium effort — only if we want the elegant end-state.

### Phase 5 — Prove the savings

- [ ] [VERIFY] P3. Two weeks after rollout, re-pull the billing ledger and compare to the Phase-0 baseline; record
      actual $/mo saved per repo. Target landing: **fleet ~$1,000/mo → ~$300–400/mo**, and structurally flat when
      activity grows (glue cost stays on our VM; only real test minutes scale).

## Expected impact (rough — Phase-0 will make exact)

| Step                                         | Effort | Est. monthly saving            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| 1. Self-host switchboard + cron glue         | Low    | ~$400–500 fleet                |
| 2. Collapse `quality-gates-v2` fan-out       | Low    | ~$50–80                        |
| 3. Retire duplicate promote bot + slow crons | Low    | ~$30–50                        |
| 4. (Later) Serverless `ci-status-update`     | Medium | folds into #1, removes VM load |

## The honest tradeoff

Self-hosted runners are infrastructure **we** now maintain (patching, disk, capacity, auto-restart). For lightweight
glue on a VM we already run 24/7 that is nearly free. For heavy test fleets it is real work — which is exactly why the
proposal keeps heavy test jobs on GitHub-hosted and only moves the glue.

## Decisions needed (operator) before any of this becomes `active`

1. Approve the direction at all? (self-host glue vs leave as-is vs a different approach)
2. Runner host: shared orchestrator VM vs dedicated small runner VM?
3. Which promote bot survives (`ldr-to-main-promote` vs `-fleet`)?
4. Do we want Phase 4 (serverless ci-status-update), or is self-hosting enough?
5. Acceptable cron cadence during freeze (hourly? event-only?).

- `codex/05-infrastructure/` — runner + VM infra conventions; workflow-template rollout
- `codex/04-architecture/ci-alerting.md` — notify-slack carrier (touched if cron cadence changes)
- Related: `plans/active/issues/github_billing_dashboard_access_2026_07_09.md` (the billing-token that made this
  measurable), `plans/active/cicd_mvp_ldr_to_main_pipeline_2026_06_30.md` (the LDR→main promotion refactor this
  overlaps)

## Progress Log

- 2026-07-15 — Plan drafted from the live billing investigation (this session). Evidence: Enhanced-Billing ledger
  Jun/Jul 2026 + PM 1000-run/13.5h Actions run-mix sample. Status draft, human-only, suggestions-not-final. Awaiting
  operator ruling on § "Decisions needed".
- 2026-07-15 — **Superset options analysis added**:
  [`github_actions_cost_reduction_options_analysis_2026_07_15.md`](github_actions_cost_reduction_options_analysis_2026_07_15.md)
  (4 parallel investigations). This plan is the execution vehicle for the **self-host** path; the companion doc is the
  wider decision menu (self-host vs fold-into-deployment-api vs RunsOn; the no-infra GitHub-native fixes incl. two
  latent bugs; and why Cloud Build / monorepo / merge-queue were rejected). Baseline rate corrected to **$0.006/min**.
- 2026-07-15 — **Phase 1 STEP 1 cracked** (operator: B1 on the planning-VM). Authored the runner infra under
  `scripts/self-hosted-runners/` (setup/wrapper/systemd template+slice/classifier/runbook) — pinned runner v2.335.1 +
  sha256, JIT-ephemeral, repo-scoped to PM (all glue lives here), CPU-capped to protect the orchestrator, shellcheck
  clean. `classify-glue-workflows.sh` → 52 MOVE / 4 KEEP. Files created LOCAL/uncommitted (operator: "no push"); deploy
  on the VM + the runs-on flip are the next steps, gated on operator go.
