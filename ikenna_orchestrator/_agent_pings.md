<!--
Lightweight ping ledger — the intra-side doorbell (Ikenna's main ↔ Ikenna's spawned tabs).

For Ikenna ↔ Harsh CROSS-SIDE comms use plans/active/_agent_pings.md instead — keep the
two ledgers separate so the cross-side surface stays uncluttered with intra-Ikenna
STARTED/DONE acks.

Sub-agents append a one-liner here when they need attention from the main agent.
The main agent polls this file every ~1 min while operator is active (stretches to
~5 min when ledger empty for 30+ min), reads the referenced plan doc, answers in
the plan doc's `## Open questions` section, then removes the line from this file.

Format (one line per active ping):
  [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC] <agent-tag> — <one-liner with plan-doc pointer>

Examples:
  [2026-05-08 09:14 UTC] defi-launch-tab — STARTED Tab 2 (plans/active/defi_master_2026_05_07.md)
  [2026-05-08 09:32 UTC] live-pipeline-tab — Q on Phase 4 MDPS reader template; see plans/active/live_pipeline_mtds_mdps_features_2026_05_08.md
  [2026-05-08 10:01 UTC] alerting-tab — DONE Tab 6 Phase 2 KillSwitchBus rule wiring; see plans/active/alerting_service_live_rules_2026_05_07.md

This file is EPHEMERAL — entries are removed when handled. Full Q&A history lives
in the referenced plan doc's `## Open questions` section (status badges 🟡 BLOCKED
→ ✅ RESOLVED).

When this ledger consistently has 15-20+ active pings, signal Ikenna to spawn a
SECOND main agent in another tab; two main agents can divide the ledger using a
[CLAIMED-BY: main-1] / [CLAIMED-BY: main-2] marker on each ping.
